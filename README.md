# Brynhildr
This was a hobby project I did to learn Construct 2, a game development engine. The game is a 1 stage 2D platformer.

I started working on this game in 2015, as a learning project in development, visual art, and game design. 

All sprite and background art is of my own design.

The musical intro is used with permission and comes from https://chibodeecrocket.bandcamp.com/album/jon-von-wonderful-presents-jon-von-wonderland. Track: The Shred Friends


## To run this game:

1. Download and install Construct 2 from https://www.scirra.com/construct2 (the free version will allow you to open and run the project).
2. From Construct 2, open the file in the repository labeled Brynhildr.caproj.
3. Click the play button located within the upper left toolbar of the application. (The game is setup by default to playing inside a google chrome browser)
